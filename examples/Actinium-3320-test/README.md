Actinium-3320 is a very simple 8-bit processeor designed as a logic sim circuit. In this example, the processor is connected to an 8-bit ROM containing
a program that prints the message "Hi" via a CharStreamPrinter attached to OUT1 of the processor. When simulated, a "Hi" should appear at the bottom left
of the screen. The top section of the screen shows the current state of various lines, registers and buses within the processor via an LEDArray. See 
`Actinium-3320.md` for details regarding the processor.
